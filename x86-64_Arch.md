# Architecture
  ## CISC vs RISC
    ### CISC ( Complex Instruction Set Computer )
      - Intel uses CISC 
      - Has lots of very specific instructions that do not have a general use case and are unlikely to be seen often.
      - Important to learn the manual and to lookup instructions that aren't common when you encounter them.
      - Variable length instructions, between 1-15 bytes long.
    ### RISC ( Reduced Instruction Set Computer )
      - Typically has more registers and has fixed sized instructions.
      - PowerPC, ARM, SPARC, MIPS all use this architecture
